# Snake Game AI

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of AI models for the classic Snake game using PyGame and PyTorch.

## Files

- `snake.py`: Multiple AI models with different hyperparameters, trained simultaneously using Deep Q-Learning (DQN).
- `v2.py`: Single AI model trained using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to play the Snake game.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyGame
- PyTorch

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Run `snake.py` or `v2.py`.
3. Observe the AI-controlled snake(s) playing the game and learning.
